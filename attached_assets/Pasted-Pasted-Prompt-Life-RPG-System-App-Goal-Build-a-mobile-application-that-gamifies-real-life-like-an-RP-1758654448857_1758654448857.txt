Prompt: “Life RPG System App”

Goal:
Build a mobile application that gamifies real life like an RPG (Role-Playing Game). Users create daily tasks (“quests”), track progress, earn XP, level up, and customize everything (tasks, rewards, XP system).

1. Core Features

Customizable Quests/Tasks

Users can add, edit, or delete quests (example: Meditation, Study, Exercise).

Each quest has:

Title

Description

Time (optional)

XP value

Category (health, study, work, personal)

XP & Level System

Completing a quest adds XP.

Level increases when XP threshold is reached.

Progress bar for current level.

Streak Tracker

Track daily streaks.

Show streak count (🔥 symbol).

If user misses a day, streak resets.

Rewards System

Users can create rewards (watch anime, eat a snack, play a game).

Rewards can be unlocked after reaching a certain XP or completing streaks.

Categories/Tags

Users can group tasks (Health, Study, Career, Mindfulness).

Each category shows stats (e.g., 300 XP earned in “Health”).

2. Optional Features

Daily Summary Screen

Show quests completed, XP gained, streaks, and level progress.

Leaderboards (Social Mode)

Compare progress with friends.

Reminders/Notifications

“Your quest Meditation is ready!”

Themes/Customization

Light/Dark theme

Fantasy RPG skin (like Pocket FM style)

3. Data & Storage

User Profile:

Name, Level, Current XP, Total XP, Streak Count.

Storage Options:

Local (SQLite/Room DB) → works offline.

Cloud (Firebase/MongoDB) → sync across devices.

4. Gamification Mechanics

XP Example System:

Meditation 20 min = +20 XP

1 hour coding = +50 XP

Exercise = +30 XP

Reading = +40 XP

Level Formula:

Level Up every 500 XP (customizable).

Achievements:

“7-Day Streak Master”

“1000 XP in Health”

“Early Riser (30 days at 4am)”

5. Tech Stack Suggestion

Frontend (Mobile App):

Android (Java/Kotlin) or React Native/Flutter (cross-platform).

Backend (optional, for sync):

Node.js + Express + MongoDB / Firebase.

UI:

RPG-style interface (progress bars, quest cards, streak icons).

6. First MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Create quests with XP.

Complete quests → XP increases.

Level system works.

Streaks tracked daily.

Save data locally.

7. Future Expansion

AI Coach: Suggests quests automatically based on habits.

Voice Assistant: “Hey, your next quest is ready!”

Wearable Integration: Sync with smartwatches for exercise quests.

Community Challenges: Join “guilds” and do quests with friends.

📝 Final Prompt (ready-to-use for AI/devs):

“Build a mobile app called Life RPG System. The app should let users turn their daily tasks into RPG quests. Users can create/edit quests with XP values, track progress, level up, maintain streaks, and unlock rewards. Everything must be customizable: tasks, XP, rewards, level thresholds. Store data locally (Room DB) with optional Firebase sync. The UI should look like a game: quests displayed as cards, progress bars for XP/levels, streak counters, and customizable themes. Include notifications for tasks and a daily summary screen. Expandable for future features like AI suggestions, leaderboards, and community quests.”
